============================================================
Thank you for installing {N}ativeScript Snippets!
============================================================

This package contains XML snippets for NativeScript's UI components
(Layouts and Widgets) as well as some frequently used attributes.

UI components are prefixed with "ns", while attributes do not have a prefix.

All snippets are based on the official {N} documentation:
https://docs.nativescript.org/

Feel free to edit the contents of this package, make contributions and suggest improvements.

If you happen to also use Visual Studio Code, please have a look at
https://github.com/tsvetan-ganev/nativescript-vscode-snippets
where I have uploaded the same snippets but for Microsoft's code editor.
